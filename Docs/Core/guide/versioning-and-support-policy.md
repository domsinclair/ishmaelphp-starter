# Versioning and Support Policy

This page documents the official versioning, backwards-compatibility (BC) guarantees, and supported platforms for Ishmael.

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Ishmael follows SemVer 2.0.0:
- MAJOR (x.0.0): Breaking changes, removal of deprecated APIs.
- MINOR (x.y.0): Backwards compatible features and improvements.
- PATCH (x.y.z): Backwards compatible bug fixes and docs/CI-only changes.

During the v0.x series we treat documented public APIs as stable within a minor line (e.g., v0.1.x). We reserve the right to make necessary adjustments before 1.0.

## Supported PHP Versions and Platforms

- Minimum PHP version: 8.2
- CI test matrix: PHP 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 on Ubuntu Linux and Windows
- macOS is community-supported (no CI job yet)

These versions are reflected in composer constraints and CI.

## Deprecations

When feasible, APIs will be marked as deprecated in a MINOR release and removed in the next MAJOR release. Deprecations are annotated in PHPDoc and documented in the CHANGELOG.

## Conventional Commits and Changelog

We use Conventional Commits to drive automated changelog and releases. Important types:
- feat: a new feature (usually MINOR)
- fix: a bug fix (PATCH)
- docs, ci, test, refactor, perf, build, chore: housekeeping (PATCH or no release)
- feat!: breaking change (MAJOR)

Changelogs and GitHub Releases are generated by Release Please.

## Release cadence

- Patch releases: as needed for fixes.
- Minor releases: when notable features are ready and tested.

See the repository root VERSIONING.md for full policy details.
