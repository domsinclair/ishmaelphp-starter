# Ishmael PHP Documentation

Welcome to the Ishmael PHP documentation. This site is built with MkDocs (Material theme) and is intended to be a living, versioned set of end‑user guides and references.

- Guides: step-by-step introductions and tutorials
- How‑to: short task-oriented recipes
- Concepts: deeper explanations of core ideas
- Reference: auto-generated API and routes summaries

To contribute: update Markdown under this folder and ensure your code changes include docblocks so the API reference generators can pick them up.
